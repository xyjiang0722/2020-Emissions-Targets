# About
This repo contains the code and instructions for producing the results in:
Jiang, X., Kim, S., Lu, S. Limited Accountability and Awareness in Corporate Emissions Target Outcomes. (2024).

# Requirements For Using Code In This Repo

1. You need to have `python`, `Stata`, and `R` programming capabilities, or at least environments to run code in these languages, on your computer. 

# Code Description

`0_clean_data` - Codes for cleaning the raw data used in the paper

`1_combine_data` - Codes for merging the data to construct final datasets and cleaning additional data based on the merged data

`2_figures` - Codes for creating the descriptive figures and plotting the results from econometric models in the paper

`3_tables` - Codes for creating the descriptive tables and outputting regression results

`4_misc` - Codes for producing additional back-of-envelop calculations for the paper

The analysis in the paper proceeds in **five steps** following the code, which is reflected in `master.do`. 

# Setup 

1. Create a working directory for the project.
   
2. In the directory, create 5 folders named `code`, `raw data`, `cleaned files`, `figures`, and `tables`.
   
3. Save the code files in this repository to the `code` folder.
